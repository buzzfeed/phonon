class Reference(object):
    """
    Represents a reference to some resource in the network. Handles reference
    counting, dereferencing, locking/ownership, and maintaining whether or not
    resources were externally modified.

    This class also provides a layer of abstraction on failover and cleanup. In
    the event of total process failure; a reference on that process will expire
    and be subsequently detected/recovered by this class to the extent updates
    overlap.

    More in-depth:

    When a process acquires a `Reference` to a resource it attempts to lock
    that resource. It will block by default for a total of Process.BLOCKING_TIMEOUT
    seconds (defaults to 500s) before raising a Reference.AlreadyLocked
    exception

    That process/reference will attempt to connect to the backend, and retry
    until either successful completion of the task or python's maximum
    recursion depth has been reached (100 retries), sleeping
    Process.RETRY_SLEEP seconds between each retry (defaults to 0.5s).

    Upon successfully locking; `Reference` will create a record with the key
    "{0}.reflist".format(pid) in redis where the key is the unique id for the
    process this code is running on and the value is the unix timestamp for the
    time the process last modified that entry. If a pid is in that list it is
    assumed they currently have an active session for whatever resource is
    locked. If the record was created longer ago than the session length it is
    assumed the process "fell over". It's reference will be cleaned up and the
    reference count will be decremented.

    Reference counts are calculated by the length of the json structure
    described above after process failures have been resolved.
